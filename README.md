# Numerical Methods

This Repository contains python scripts that implement a number of numerical methods, used to solve Ordinary and partial differential equations directed towards engineering problems. Originally, this contained the work for the MECH5315M Engineering Computational Methods Module, however has since evolved into personal learning geared towards solving more complex problems.
